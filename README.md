# Flashcard Practice System

This Python script implements a simple flashcard practice system. It allows users to create, manage, and practice with flashcards. The system is based on two classes:

1. **Card Class:** Represents an individual flashcard with a question and an answer.

2. **CardList Class:** Manages a list of flashcards and provides functionalities like adding, removing, shuffling, importing from a file, and practicing.

## Features
- **Import from File:** Load flashcards from a formatted text file (`questions.txt`), making it easy to bulk import questions and answers.
- **Interactive Practice:** Practice mode allows users to go through shuffled flashcards, testing their knowledge and marking their answers as correct or incorrect.
- **Dynamic Card Management:** Users can add, remove, and view flashcards interactively.

## Usage
1. **Adding Cards:** Choose option 1 to add a new flashcard, providing both the question and answer.
2. **Viewing Cards:** Choose option 2 to display all flashcards in the list.
3. **Removing Cards:** Choose option 4 to remove a flashcard by specifying its index.
4. **Importing from File:** Choose option 5 to import flashcards from `questions.txt`.
5. **Practice Mode:** Enter practice mode (option 1) to shuffle and practice with the flashcards.

## How to Run
Execute the script and follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the flashcard system.

Feel free to customize and enhance the script to suit your specific needs!
